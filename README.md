WORK IN PROGRESS 
# Summary

Best way to learn things in IT is to get hands-on experience, whether it's professional experience or none professional, it's the effort and the passion that matters. As an upcoming Cybersecurity professional. I want to get better and more familiar with different OSes and how they behave and some tools such as Wazuh. Big aspect of Cybersecurity is the systems we run, such as RHEL and Windows Server. I have an upcoming project about Windows Server, this project focuses only on Linux. 

# Setup

- Unfortunately, my budget for hardware is very tight but I still want to learn and make most out of my Proxmox server. 

**Laptop Specs:**
- **CPU:** Intel Core i5-8250U
- **GPU:** Intel UHD Graphics 620 (Integrated)
- **Memory:** 8GB
- **Disk:** 210GB
- **Network**: Single Device 

**Servers:**
- Arch Server
- Linux Server (Ubuntu Server)
- Wazuh Server (an EDR Server)
- RockyRHCSA (Rocky Linux, I called it RHCSA because I wanted to practice for my RHCSA exam using Rocky)
- FedoraRHCSA (Same deal as Rocky Linux, Fedora to practice my RHCSA Exam) 
- Alpine Server (Runs Containers)
  
**Note:** I only run one or two servers at a time, otherwise my system will crash. 


# Whats in my Arch Server? 

I run Arch Linux on my main PC desktop. We all know Arch is known to break every now and then, sometimes it takes one command. Awhile the solution to that is backups and/or rollbacks, however that takes some space on a hard drive. So therefore, 

**The Purpose:** 
- Headless (Lightweight)
- Learn, write and run scripts  
- Running as a test environment for updates, packages, software, anything that may break my main PC Desktop. 
- Rely on CLI
